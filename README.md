🚀 Cost Optimized AWS Architecture using Terraform
📌 Project Overview

This project provisions a cost-optimized AWS infrastructure using Terraform in the ap-south-1 (Mumbai) region.

The architecture deploys:

Custom VPC

Private Subnet

EC2 Instance (No Public IP)

IAM Role with SSM access

VPC Endpoints for secure private communication

The goal is to reduce AWS cost by avoiding NAT Gateway and public exposure while maintaining secure access using AWS Systems Manager (SSM).

🏗 Architecture Components

VPC with CIDR 10.0.0.0/16

Private Subnet (10.0.1.0/24)

EC2 instance inside private subnet

IAM Role attached with AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore

VPC Endpoints for private AWS access

💰 Cost Optimization Strategy

❌ No NAT Gateway (saves money)

❌ No Public IP for EC2

✅ Private subnet deployment

✅ SSM Session Manager for secure access

✅ Tag-based resource management

🛠 Tools Used
